## Interpreting Language: Natural vs. Formal

In college, I took a Computational Theory class that made me think more deeply about language, both the formal languages we use in programming and the natural languages we speak every day. These languages share some similarities but are also different in ways that make human communication uniquely complex and sometimes confusing. In this post, I want to discuss both formal and natural languages and explore their importance.

### The Alphabet

At their core, both natural and formal languages are built from a basic alphabet. In computing, we have the binary alphabet of 0s and 1s. This simplicity is incredibly powerful because, from just these two symbols, we can build everything, from complex software systems to the very text you are reading now. Natural languages, on the other hand, typically use alphabets ranging from A to Z (or their equivalents in other languages). Interestingly, these natural language characters can also be mapped to binary code, as seen in ASCII (you can check out the codes [here](https://www.ascii-code.com/)).

If we think of the human brain as a program, it takes input, processes it through a "black box," and produces output. In computational terms, this is similar to a function: a mapping from input to output. For a function to be well-defined, each input must map to exactly one output. This is a comforting rule in the world of formal languages and computers.

### The Complexity of Human Language Interpretation

Natural language works quite differently from programming languages. In programming, interpreters consistently map one input to one output with precision. However, natural language is much more ambiguous, largely due to the presence of multiple interpreters—the minds of those who hear or read what we say. Each interpreter processes the same input differently, based on their unique experiences, knowledge, and state of mind.

This variability becomes even more apparent when you consider that a single interpreter, or listener, doesn't remain in the same state throughout the day. Saying the exact same thing to someone two hours later could result in a completely different response (output) due to a shift in their mood or state of mind. For instance, they might be grumpy or distracted the second time, leading them to process the input differently and generate a different output.

Beyond the complexity of the interpreter, there’s also complexity in the input itself. Spoken language, in particular, isn’t just about the words being said. It also includes tone, body language, and other subtle cues that are all processed along with the actual text. A phrase like “You’re brilliant” could be interpreted as a sincere compliment, a sarcastic jab, or even a backhanded remark depending on how it’s delivered.


So, confusion arises at both the input and interpreter levels. On the input side, there are subtle cues such as tone and body language. On the interpreter side, there is the state of mind of the person receiving the message.

Lastly, as mentioned earlier, there’s the fact that there are multiple interpreters, with each brain shaped by unique life experiences, personality, and perspective. No two people interpret a statement in exactly the same way because no two people have identical interpreting systems. It’s as if each of us is running a slightly different version of the same software. For instance, one person with a rich vocabulary and deep understanding of a topic might catch subtle nuances in conversation, while another might miss them entirely.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Complexity

While formal languages like those used in programming offer clarity and consistency, natural languages remind us of the complexity and richness of human communication. The next time you find yourself in a conversation, remember that your words are being processed by a unique interpreter. And just like with programming, refining your inputs (words, tone, and body language) can lead to better, more accurate outputs.

Understanding this complexity is the first step in becoming a better communicator. As technology advances, we may get closer to bridging these gaps in understanding. It’s dystopian, but innovations like neural interfaces, such as Neuralink, suggest a future where someone could understand exactly what you're thinking, or even simulate your brain’s context to better interpret your thoughts.

For now, we navigate the nuances, doing our best to ensure that what we say is what we mean, and that it is understood as intended, though we can never be perfect.
